An app, that allows users to easily read and engage with posts in a carousel
format. Users can swipe through a carousel of posts and expand each post card to
view comments left by other users. Every post card can be expanded by clicking
the arrow at the right bottom angular. Then all comments leaved for this post
will be asynchronously downloaded and user can see theirs.
